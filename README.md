Requirements:
- Develop a mobile app with the 4 screens shown in the URL.
- Since there is no backend Web API available, please use mock JSON data to mimic the web api response.
- The JS functional logic must be implemented as well, such as search function, calculation, etc. (whichever applicable in the screens you are going to develop).
- Use React Native v0.59.x only.
- Itâ€™s OK to use Redux or AsyncStorage to cache the state data.
- Since there are no UIUX styling specs & assets provided, you can just use any colour code and images that are similar to the sample screens provided in the url.

Submission:
- Push your code into github / gitlab / bitbucket. Then, send the URL to us to review your code.
- Build an apk package and send to us to review.
